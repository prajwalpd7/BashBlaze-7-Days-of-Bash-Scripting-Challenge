# Day 4 Submission Part 2: Monitoring Metrics Using Shell Scripting
For this task, I have created a script `monitoring_metrics.sh `. This script has the ability to monitor system metrics such as CPU Usage, Ram Usage, and Disk Usage and display them in an interactive way. Also, this script can be used to interactively monitor & start a service.
